        plan hostel activities, and cultivate a sense of community in student
        residence. The Residence Master is assisted by a group of Residence Tutors.

          <b>Residents’ Associations (RAs) & Floor Committees:</b>
          <br><br>
          An excellent way to become involved in residence life and develop your
          leadership skills is to join your Residents’ Association (RA) or become
          a Floor Representative. The Residents’ Associations are independent
          student bodies and the driving force behind most of the social programs
          for the halls. They offer a forum for you to voice concerns and propose
          new ideas. Floor committees and floor representatives are of a more
          informal nature. They aim to create and cultivate a supportive network
          among residents living on the same floor. Being a member of the Residents’
          Association, becoming a Floor Representative, or simply committing
          yourself to becoming an active participant or volunteer in hall
          activities, can definitely add an extra dimension to your university life!
