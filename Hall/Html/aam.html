      13 October 2019 was the annual athletic meet for all hall residents in
      City University of Hong Kong. It was the first PEK Cup Event in Year
      2019/2020. Everyone, counting from Hall tutors, PEK manager to
      residence-helpers worked hard to make this athletic meet a grand success.
      The athletic meet began with the opening speech by Mr. ., followed by the
      march past of the hall representatives. The round of cheers is perfect for
      firing up that fighting spirit.<br><br> All of the 11 halls, including us
      LEE SHAU KEE HALL, were competing with each other in a fierce but
      friendly manner for the male and female 4 x 100 relay.  Hard work
      always pays off. Our female team was proudly awarded the first-rounded up
      for female 4 x 100 relay. They are (name.. ). Congratulations to Hall 6!
      We hope all participants were left with a sense of pride at their efforts
      over the past few weeks, and all those present will look forward to the
      next yearâ€™s edition.
