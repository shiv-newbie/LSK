      After 2 weeks of preparing, finally LEE SHAU KEE Hall held its Welcoming
      Night Party. LEE SHAU KEE Hall Welcoming night is an annual event that is
      held at the beginning of the semester. Its purpose is to welcome new and
      current student, both Local and International students to the hall. This
      year, it is held on 17th September at Multifunctional Hall A. The event
      started with senior RT Muhammad giving speech and talking about the
      returning scheme. Then it is followed by performances by the residents of
      hall 6. There are singing and dancing which all performed by hall 6
      residents. Also in welcoming night, all of the RTs were introduced to the
      residents. This year, the food for welcoming night were pizza (both halal
      and non halal pizza were there). This event was organized by LEE SHAU KEE
      Hall own residents with the help of RTs. The organizer is selected through
      lucky draw and extra returning points will be given to organizers. Our MC,
      Alvin and Eden both did very well in keeping the event going. The
      decoration is really stunning and the food is really delicious. The games
      “Form a Team” and “Jump In Jump Out” is so much fun. It was great for all
      of us in ice-breaking. The event was attended by many participants in
      which most of them are hall 6 residents. It was a really memorable event
      for both the organizers, since they can learn to work together with other
      people from different background, and for the participants since they can
      meet their hall mates.
