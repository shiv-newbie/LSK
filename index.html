        lobby, to softwares including the smiling, caring and loving
        security officers, cleaning staff, resident tutors and all
        other fellow mates on all floors.
        Again, I warmly welcome you and look forward to your great
        living and learning experience at Lee Shau Kee Hall in

        At LSK Hall, we are proud to have established the tradition of
        “home sweet home”. All LSK residents belong to one big family.
        We accept individual differences and we live in harmony. We have
        open and caring hearts towards our fellow hallmates who we regard
        as our family members. We laugh together, we cry together, and
        last but not least, we grow together.

        While we recognize the importance of academic learning, we also
        value cultural, social, physical and spiritual learning. We have
        a passionate and dedicated Residents’ Association (RA) whose members
        work with Resident Tutors (RTs) to organize fruitful and enjoyable
        activities for members of our LSK Hall family. We value fun and
        joy as much as hard work and success. Not only do we study hard
        together, but we also do our best in activities like community
        services and inter-hall competitions

        Hall 6 is all about appreciating that society is made up of many
        different groups with different interests, skills, talents and needs. It
        also respects and expeects that you recognise that people in society can
        have different religious beliefs and practices.
        <br><br>
        We are all about people being treated fairly, equally and specifically to
        their needs. We enhance inclusion regardless of race, gender, disability,
        religion or belief, sexual orientation and age. We encourages an
        environment that allows people from different backgrounds to reach their
        full potential.
